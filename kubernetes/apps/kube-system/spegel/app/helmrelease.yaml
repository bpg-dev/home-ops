    # Chart defaults are 128Mi/128Mi which is too low during image pull spikes and causes OOMKilled.
    # Keep the request modest but give the registry process enough headroom.
    # CPU limit removed: Spegel's libp2p DHT can spike during P2P cache rebuilds (e.g., after node
    # reboots). CPU throttling causes a feedback loop where Spegel can't complete work and keeps
    # retrying. See: https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/issues/12127
